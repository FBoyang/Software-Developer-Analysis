SDL2017More jobs at Galaxy SolutionsOur developers have been contributing code to major organizations and open source projects for over 25 years now. They’ve also been writing books, speaking at conferences, and helping push software development forward -- changing companies and even industries along the way.

As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we’re delivering the best possible solution. Our Developers play an important role in leading these projects to success.

We believe that to flourish in this role, you're good at:

Technical Skills
• Coding. Our clients don’t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a developer, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in a variety of languages, and experience in one or two: Java, javascript, and React are high on our list. (Other notables: Python,Ruby, Scala, .NET, Clojure.)
• You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration and pair programming.
• Understanding and playing a part in the entire cycle of... software consulting and delivery (ideation, project conception, UX, code, testing, deployment, and around again)
• Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients for a long time. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.
• Ideally looking for candidates who have at least two (2) years of professional industry experience in software development.

Soft Skills
• Thinking big and acting fast. You’ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you’re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations’ tech strategies.
• Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you’re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.
• Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client’s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you’ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills.

And here’s some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ThoughtWorks.
• A real commitment to “changing the face of IT” -- our way of thinking about diversity and inclusion. Over the past ten years, we’ve implemented a lot of initiatives to make ThoughtWorks a place that reflects the world around us, and to make this a welcoming home to technologists of all stripes. We’re not perfect, but we’re actively working towards true gender balance for our business and our industry, and you’ll see that diversity reflected on our project teams and in offices.
• Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.
• No pigeon-holing: at ThoughtWorks, there’s no applying to new roles. With time, you’ll build trust and credibility and move easily into new roles if you’re inclined, like trying out life in a QA or BA’s shoes.
• Support to grow as a technologist outside of your role at ThoughtWorks. This is why ThoughtWorkers have written over 100 books and can be found speaking at (and, ahem, keynoting) tech conferences all over the world. We love to learn and share knowledge, and you’ll find a community of passionate technologists eager to back your endeavors, whatever they may be. You’ll also receive financial support to attend conferences every year.
• An organizational commitment to social responsibility. ThoughtWorkers challenge each other to be just a little more thoughtful about the world around us, and we believe in using our profits for good. All around the world, you’ll find ThoughtWorks supporting great causes and organizations in both official and unofficial capacities.
